# The joy and pain of lists

## Use cases

1. Knowing which bookshop has more books
2. From the common collections, which has more of them complete?
3. Variation: From the common collections, which has more of them with more books (assuming we never know if the collection is complete)?
4. Exchange complete collections 
5. Compare who has more of different authors
6. Variation: the same but then order the ones needed to have more than the other bookshop
6. Steal books from one bookshop to another. Buy the rest from the provider
7. Steal all books from authors we don't have
8. Book exchange between bookshops (simple)
9. Monopoly: buying the other bookshop


Future interesting use cases:
- Introduce genres (fantasy, terror, romance) and supergenres (essay, poetry, narrative)
- We need to consult the provider to know the complete sizes of the collections
- Book order is introduced, then subsagas/universes and prequels are introduced
- New books are published and therefore the existing collections may not be correct in terms of Size/IsComplete
- Employees with different working times which have different skills and can perform different actions: depending on the day, we can call these employees or we need to queue their work
